"""Bazel macros for this repository's Cargo workspace members.

Every knob these macros need — crate name, edition, feature set, dependency
labels, workspace lints — already exists in the `@crates` repo that
`crate.from_cargo` generates from `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock`. Reading it from
there rather than restating it per crate keeps the BUILD files from drifting
away from the manifests Cargo still resolves.
